1) Introduction- 0:00
    Technologies:
        React, Firebase, Matetial-UI, Express.js, Redux- needed due to many 
            components. Without this the components will passing data from one
            component to the next(prop drilling) which is a bad practice on large 
            projects. Redux creates a application wide state.

            
2) Create and Read Data- 7:03
    Add the firebase command line interface:
        npm install -g firebase-tools

    Login into Firebase:    
        firebase login

    Initialize Firebase:
        init firebase
    NOTE: At this point add the Functions feature.

    To deploy firebase:
        firebase deploy
    The deploy will create a http endpoint to work within Postman. When the post 
        route is executed, the helloWorld function runs from the index.js file 
        wihtin the functions directory.
    NOTE: Deploy everytime the index.js is changed to use new functions.

    NOTE: As firebase deploy takes a long time to run, instead deploy locally with:
        firebase serve

    ISSUE: With local host had an issue when posting for the createScream() function:
        Error: Could not load the default credentials. Browse to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started for more information.
    Quick Fix: downgrade to version 6.8:
        Run "npm install -g firebase-tools@6.8.0"


3) Express and Formatting Response- 27:57
    Move to the functions folder and add express 
        npm i express

    Add new express get() function(replace getScreams function), add api 
        export, then redeploy:
            firebase deploy


4) User Registration- 42:37
    Add Firebase and email/password authentication from Firebase Account.

    within the functions directory, add firebase:
        npm i firebase
